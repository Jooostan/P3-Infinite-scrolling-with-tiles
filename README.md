Title: Tiled Ocean

Description: An infinite scroller with tiles using starter code
from - https://github.com/julinas/p3-endless-scene-starter 
The page a random assortment of tiles based on the given world
seed using noise to distribute the different tiles

Tile Types:

Auto Tiling:
- Water & Sand
- Rock & Sand

Interactivity:

- Clicking on the water places a shark in the water
- Clicking on the rock places a seagull
(The placed object changes depending on the tile type which changes
along with the seed)

Artist Statement: I was trying to make that of small little islands
with assorted rocks amongst the different lands. I struggled to
with the assorment of tiles to replicate what I wanted. I also
struggled a little with the more difficult edge cases of the auto
tiling. I only check the cardinal neighbors without exploring the
diagonal cases. I also struggled to get really seamless tiles, but
was able to do my best to achive the auto tiling effect.
